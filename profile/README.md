<h2 align='center'>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:25px">  IDSM-AI is  the AI group of <a href="http://idsm.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/index.htm">IDSM</a> (Intelligent Data Storage and Management Laboratory), lead by associate professor <a href="https://lightyear416.github.io/liuyu/index.html#portfolio">Yu Liu</a>. IDSM-AI consists of 20+ members who are keen on  doing something cool using AI technology. Motivated by the industrial demand, our  research focuses on content-based storage, AI for database, AI for disk failure prediction, intelligent file system, etc.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:25px">Feel free to catch Yu Liu (liu_yu@hust.edu.cn) if interested to discuss ideas or work together for an impressive internship experience.ðŸ˜œ</p>
